# gsql-sublime
syntax formatter for GSQL in Sublime v3

This is my first stab at making a custom syntax formatter for GSQL in sublime.

Copied a lot from other samples... obviously.

Needs

- Punctuation control
- Bracket matching
- Custom color scope
- Better scope framework (instead of just copying)
